# Pytorch-Sign-Language-Detection
I trained the MNIST sign language dataset with the CNN structure I created using Pytorch and performed sign language detection in real time.

Sign Language MNIST (https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) Each training and test case represents a label (0-25) as a one-to-one map for each alphabetic letter A-Z (and no cases for 9=J or 25=Z because of gesture motions).
